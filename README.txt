ONLINE SWEET SHOP PROJECT 
Nicola Bell May 2020

This project was written to demonstrate use of JavaScript to perform calculations and DOM manipulation.
The brief was to develop a prototype / proof of concept for a pic and mix shop website for client approval before being linked to an eCommerce platform. I also tried to adhere to WGAG contrast and form labeling guidelines as an addition to the brief, using the WAVE browser plugin to highlight some of these issues.
